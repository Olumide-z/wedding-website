        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">Are kids welcome?</h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          As much as we love your little ones, we will not be including them in
          the ceremony or reception. However, we recognize that some of you will
          be traveling with your kids, so please know they are welcome at the
          Friday cocktail reception and Sunday brunch! We will also be providing
          a babysitting service at the venue during the ceremony if you cannot
          find other accommodations for them. Please reach out if you have
          questions!
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">Where should I park?</h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          There is plenty of free parking near the entrance of the hall.
        </p>

          Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?

        <p className="font-[400]">
          Yes, and we will have a golf cart available for anyone needing
          assistance getting around the property!
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">What should I wear?</h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          Emerald Green for the trad wedding and anything comfortable for the
          white wedding.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">
          Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">
          What kind of shoes should/shouldn&apos;t I wear?
        </h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          Calling all ladies! Do not wear stiletto heels. I repeat, do not wear
          stiletto heels. There are a bunch of grassy/dirt areas that you might
          have to walk in so wear chunky heels or sandals. Can&apos;t have any
          of you ruining nice shoes or breaking any ankles.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">
          Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the
          wedding?
        </h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          Yes! We would love for you to take photos and share them with us.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-[600] mt-12 mb-2">
          Whom should I call with questions?
        </h3>
        <p className="font-[400]">
          Please call our lovely maid of honor Damola with question at
          555-555-5555.
